## Work Done



- Found out what my problem was with filter's parameter as variables:
	- When using a <variable> as a parameter, the correct syntax for (e.g.) is ''not'' filter[<variable>] ''but'' filter<variable> (//no square brackets!!//), because:
	- as Eric Shulman said on [the Talk forums](https://talk.tiddlywiki.org/t/using-a-variable-from-a-filter-expression/319):  
	"The description of the syntax may be confusing, in that it uses “`[filter[<operand>]`” to show where a literal value should be inserted. However, because in this case the operand is actually a variable reference, you omit the square brackets around it, and just use  "`filter<variable>`""
	- Notice the *lack of spaces* between `filter`  and `<variable>`
- Trying to do some actual work---namely on the Introduction to volume 2 of *Play and Passivity*. Only managed to create bib refs for the texts I need to read ([](#Biblio%20for%20Intro%20of%20volume%202)). 

## Work to do

- Still need to actually read them, and work on the basis of the skeletal notes I took in Sardinia (still in manuscript form) 
- And still need to fix the **Project**/**Task** and **Task**/**Source** viewtemplates on the basis of what I learnt today (see above)
