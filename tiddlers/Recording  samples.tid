!!How to record samples (REAPER)

  #All samples go into one file, if recorded in the same sonically stable environment (to ease later cleanup)

  # Always record a “silence” patch for later de-noising

  # Use more than one mic, if possible

  # Record into Reaper tracks

  # Save each mic's track to a separate file
