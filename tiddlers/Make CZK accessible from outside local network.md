In order to access my notes from everywhere on Node.js I need to do the following:

1. [Get a domain name](#Get%20a%20Domain%20name). DONE

	Done with [OVH](ovh.com). My domain is [cleinias.xyz](#cleinias.xyz)
2. Configure dynamic DNS to link the domain name to my dynamic home IP.

	DONE with [DUNY](https://www.dynu.com)
3.	Create a C level name for the CZK server
	
		DONE, the server's name is notes.cleinias.xyz
31.	Perhaps [](#Enable%20port%20forwarding)? Check out if the [Nginx Proxy Manager](#NginxProxyManager) does it for you.
4. Set up [Nginx Proxy Manager](#NginxProxyManager) to point notes.cleinias.xyz to the node js installation on Gorgias [TODO](#TODO)
	41. {{Set  up linux on Raspeberry Pi 3}}
	42.	{{Install the nginx proxy manager on RPi 3}}
