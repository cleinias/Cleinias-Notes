Today I tried the new [[Tascam DR-40X]] field recorder I bought. I went on a hike to Tinnari and stopped on the path (toward the end, already on the old road that takes you up to mount Tinnari). I put earphones on and let it run for 8 minutes. Interestingly, I heard basically nothing. I downloaded the recording at home and can confirm that there is basically nothing there as well, with the exception of a few spots where you can heat a gentle wind (I had forgot the wind screen at home). It was indeed super quiet, but I was expecting the recorder to pick up something. Need to continue experiment with different levels, perhaps
