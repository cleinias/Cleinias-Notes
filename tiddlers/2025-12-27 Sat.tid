!!Work Done
Finished the notes on the basic process needed to create a samples-based instrument in Supercollider and Kontakt. See the [[LyX file | file:///home/stefano/Documents/Projects/Music-related-projects/Music-Concrete/superconcrete/Notes-on-sampling.lyx]] with my notes. They are based on a video by [[David Hilowitz]] available [[on YouTube|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2iEhJcrHxI&list=PLluATFZehvV2SGc1h76W8PiK-M_8_Z5VI&index=22 ]]
