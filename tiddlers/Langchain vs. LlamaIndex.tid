title: Langchain vs. LlamaIndex
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Here is the quick comparison from GeeksforGeeks:


|!Aspect|!LlamaIndex|!LangChain|
|Focus|Data ingestion, indexing and retrieval pipelines|Language model orchestration and generation|
|Indexing|Multiple optimized index types for diverse data|Emphasis on generative workflows rather than indexing|
|Querying|Semantic search and knowledge retrieval|Advanced LLM-driven text generation and tasks|
|Learning Curve|More accessible for data integration tasks|Requires deeper understanding of LLM chaining|
