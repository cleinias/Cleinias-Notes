Advanced exercise: work from a radically simplified version of one
    of  [Maessien's bird-based composition](#Maessien's%20birdsongs) and replace bird "songs" with
    real bird songs (possibly your own, but not necessarily). Actually,
    first just compare the real songs with the transcriptions for your
    own listening pleasure and analysis. Then try to "compose" simple
    structure mimicking Messiaen's simplest. See [this page
    ](https://cburrell.wordpress.com/2008/05/09/messiaen-and-bird-song/)
    for a starting point (with links to performances on YouTube) and the
    two articles by Robert Fallon.
