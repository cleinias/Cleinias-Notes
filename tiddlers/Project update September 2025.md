Project update 18 September 2025
---



Now that *the* book is finally in production (or the first volume at
least) and I can turn my mind to new (but really old) projects, here is
an update of the litte I did on this one and some new items that have
come to lights:

1.  I had decided, following the note "Note on structure" to settle on
    Loyola's *Exercises* as the model of the philosophical narrative my
    project would instantiate. Indeed the narrative would be called /
    themed as "Exercises in immanence," or something along those lines.

    *  I had taken extensive notes (I believe) of Loyola's *Exercises*
        which unfortunately I seem to have misplaced. They are in
        manuscript form.

2.  I have started reading M Chion's *Guide des objets
    sonores* which is a kind of map / digest / explanation
    of P Schaeffer's *Traité*. It is indeed very
    interesting but it certainly does not replace study of the latter.
    It does indeed help in understanding it though.

3.  Terence Dwyer's book, my initial inspiration for this project, has
    been republished by *JOAN*, a small British press in 2023.

4.  I discovered that T Dwyer had also produced a book for schools with
    roughly a subset of the content of *Composing with Tape Recorders,*
    titled *Making Electronic Music. A Course for School*, which I could
    find online and download.

    *  The book also came with two companion disks containing sounds,
        which are available on YouTube

5.  Eli Fieldsteel's book, *SuperCollider for the Creative Musician*,
    came ut, and it is a great introduction to the system from a user's
    perspective. Started to work on it.

6.  The revised edition of *The SuperCollider Book* came out in
    July 2025. Downloaded but not looked at yet.

7.  Realized Dwyer's exercises, even though they are very interesting,
    are too music-oriented to really serve my purposes. The exercises in
    immanence cannot have music production as a goal, I think. The same
    applies, to a lesser extent, to Chion's and Schaeffer's work.
    HOWEVER, their work on classification ([*typologie*]{lang="fr"} /[
    *morphologie*]{lang="fr"}) is an important component of the
    analytics of "found sound" I am after.

    *  Also, Schaeffer's distinction *version* /
        *thème* is very useful: really, what I am interested
        in, I think, is the first part of the process---the
        *version* that translates acousmatically perceived
        sounds into language, The *version* exercises, like
        their Latin analog and prototype, should allow the listener to
        gain an entry into a different world, the word of sound
        unbuckled from their production, and from there inaugurate a
        different relationship with the world as such those sound came
        from (that is the immanence part proper)

    *  So the immediate goal, or not so immediate, is to work rather
        with Chion/ Schaeffer *typologie* and produce:

        1.  A table of the categories of sounds to record (perhaps based
            on Schaeffer's own, but simplified. See his tables, and the
            discussions of them in Chion's book)

        2.  A series of preliminary exercises analogues to Dwyer's exs.
            1--13 that would use Schaeffer's categories instead of
            Dwyer's Tones / Mistones / Pseudotones / Mistones (Even
            though the relationship between the latter and Schaeffer's
            should be explored once I know more about his
            [*typologie*]{lang="fr"}. I have the feeling Dwyer's
            criteria are a simplified version of Schaeffer's with an
            emphasis on its means of production (which is of course
            absent in Schaeffer). ***To be verified.***

8.  I have acquired a not so cheap field recorder (but cheap, as field
    recorders go) that should be my workhorse for the project

9.  I also discovered that I had made recording of various sounds and
    and made some Supercollider preliminary work on them! Totally forgot
    about it. I seem to recollect the recording were made with the Zoom
    H4n field recorder I had bought and then returned. Or perhaps with
    the used field recorder that is still sitting on my desk at home.

    *  Indeed, I do have 74 cleaned out audio files on disk, in the
        <file://home/stefano/Documents/Projects/Music-related-projects/Music-Concrete/Recordings/Tones-and-pseudo-tones-and-others/Cleaned-out-and-separated-sounds>
        folder.

    *  I also have Supercollider files with functions for reading all
        the files into buffers, playing them out in specific orders,
        etc. Need to get back to those projects and remind myself of
        what they do.

10. Realized the project, as always, is very very ambitious\....
