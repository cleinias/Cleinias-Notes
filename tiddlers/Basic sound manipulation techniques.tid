List of basic, single-sound manipulation techniques (i.e. no
    "combining, splicing," etc.):

    1.  Change playing rate

    2.  Reverse

    3.  Shape amplitude (with envelopes or not)

    4.  Spectral transforms

    5.  Filter

    See also the unary and binary transformation in the additional
    *Supercollider* tutorial (in the help files)
