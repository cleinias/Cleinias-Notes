Michel Chion's little *Que-sais je* book [[Chion1982]] has
    very interesting, clear, and concise discussions of *musique
    concrète* in context, plus super-useful detailed
    historical timeline with brief discussions of pieces
    ("ephemeride"), and brief analysis of pieces. Also,
    very brief notes on techniques.
