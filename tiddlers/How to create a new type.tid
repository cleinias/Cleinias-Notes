type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

#Create a tiddler with the new type's name as title by cloning [[EmptyTypeDescription]]
# make sure it is tagged ''Meta'', and make sure it has the proper color (//#ff0000//) and proper image tag ($:/core/images/tag-button). Color and label's image are used in transcluding, so are crucial.
# Fill in the //Naming conventions// and //Fields// section of the tiddler.
# Write the template to be used when creating a new instance of the type
