**On the book's general structure and philosophical narratives in
  particular**
---

I am a philosopher, not a musician, computer scientist, or software
esengineer. Hence, the book must be a philosopher's (not just a
philosophy's one, but also) book. Which means I need a philosophical
structure: philosophical issues must drive the narrative, not musical or
technical issues. I need, in short, a strong (philosophical) narrative.

What is a philosophical narrative, in the context I am interested in? It
is---very roughly put--- the story of a journey toward some form of
enlightenment punctuated by stages, exercises, tribulations, etc. But
what is *enlightenment*? What is a philosopher trying to get clarity
about? What is he or she shining light on? The traditional
answer---which is still not too off the mark--- is simple: herself.
*Know yourself*, after all, is our institutional motto. What is often
lost in the endless repetitions of this platitude is that not one of
those who made this gnomic phrase popular in Western culture equated
self-knowledge with navel-gazing. On the contrary knowing yourself has
always meant knowing your place in the world, or, to put it better,
knowing *where you stand and what you stand against* in your everyday
life. Knowing yourself means---it has always meant---knowing how to live
in the (social, political, economic, physical, and biological) world. So
a philosophical narrative is the story of a personal journey toward a
better understanding of the *yourself-in-the-world*. (On the other hand,
a philosophical system---or a philosophy for sort---is the rhetorical
doublet of the narrative: it is the description of the world that the
journey's end state made possible. It is the theorems and the proofs vs
the messy notebooks, the context of justification vs. the context of
discovery).

So the narrative cannot avail itself of the traditional philosophical
forms, be they as formal as Spinoza's *Ethics* or as informal as
Kierkegaard's *Either/Or.* Its form is the journey, the Odyssey its
prototype. A modern example would perhaps be *Ecce homo*,
but ancient literature adopts it often, although inconsistently: from
Plato's *Republic* to Augustine's *Confessions* we have examples of
philosophical tales, educational treatises, and spiritual memoirs that
occupy different intermediate positions between the purely icastic
exposition of results attempted by *Ethics* and the patient retelling of
personal triumphs and constant setbacks of the *Pensées*.

In the Western tradition, the real flourishing of the philosophical
narrative happens in a different context: it is within the Christian
spiritual tradition that it reaches its peak, from Bonaventure's
*Itinerarium mentis in Deo*, to Loyola's *Exercises.* This
is the form that we need to hijack, thereby reversing the previous
hijacking of the form from the Hellenistic philosophy schools and return
the spiritual narrative to its philosophical context.

\[- also, need to add: a manual, a handbook, i.e. a book for your hands,
a book that requires what hands do: work. A book of of exercises, of
works ergon/erga\]

Now, going on about structure, this also means that the exercises cannot
be only musical---in fact they are not intrinsically musical, they are
so only mediately with respect to their goal, which is not musical but
philosophical. How to bridge between the two levels? How to connect
recording and classifying sounds (exercise 1) or the splicing of virtual
tape strips to philosophical issues? One possibility is to link them to
explicit philosophical discussions and/or texts. For instance, the first
exercise could be linked to a discussion of technology mediation,
perhaps with a comment on Simondon. Or would it be better to just offer
a link and questions on the text?

This would mean that every exercise has an accompanying set of readings
(perhaps to pair with the listening list?) and comments. And perhaps a
similar set of "Expansions" that would branch out into additional
suggestions. (However, I do start to feel the fox/hedgehog problem
coming up. Focused set of exercises, or broad array of options?)
