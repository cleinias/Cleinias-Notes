How to plan a recording session 

  # Write description of the basic concept or goal

  # Figure out what to record (objects, instruments, etc.)

  # Figure out how many samples are needed, counting  round-robins, velocity layers, number of notes (e.g. may be go for stacked major or minor thirds (= 3, resp. 4, notes per octave), or just by stacked major fifths). 
	Use a matrix of this kind, for instance:

|!Object|!Method|!Range|!No. Samples|!Velocity Layers|!Round Robins|!Total|
|Bass rec.|Minor 3rds|F3-G5|9|1|4|36|
||||||Total:|36|
