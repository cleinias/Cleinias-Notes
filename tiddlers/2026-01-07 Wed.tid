!! Work done
* not much, sick again.
** Added a few references on Kandinski for the Introduction to volume 2: [[a (the?) standard biography|Grohmann1958]], two catalogues, one of the exhibition of his [[Bauhaus years|KandinskyBauhaus1966]] and the other of the exhiition of his [[Munich years|KandinskyMunich1982]], plus a [[recent work|Florman2014]] (2014) on his aesthetics.
* also started to read both [[D'Anna's|DAnna2022]] book and the [[book by Kojève|Kojeve2022]] on Kandinsky (just read the introductions to both). Both very interesting and certainly needed.
